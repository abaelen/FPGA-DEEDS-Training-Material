2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin cENABLE/Enable.tr_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cRESET/Reset.tr_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cRESET/Reset.tr_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on ck_io0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cRESET/Reset.pu_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cRESET/Reset.pu_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cRESET/Reset.tr_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cRESET/Reset.tr_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cRESET/o_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cRESET/o_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
